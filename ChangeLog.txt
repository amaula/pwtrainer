*****************

* 1.6 @ 23.03.2012
  - Changed the quality requirements to more "strict" behaviour - average over
    five last correct entries and stricter mean time and std limits.


* 1.4 @ 23.03.2012
  - Removed dependency to matplotlib by implementing the mean and std 
    functions
  - Now the app should work on Win + Linux; the read_char facility is now
    cross platform


* 1.2 @ 22.03.2012
  - Added feature to be able to quit the application ;)
  - Added mean/min/max/std calculation for pressed keys; when the password is 
    typed fast enough, assume the password is learned well


* 1.0 @ 22.03.2012
  - First release, train passwords by asking them multiple times and telling
    whether the answer was correct or not
